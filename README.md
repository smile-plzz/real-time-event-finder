# Real-Time Event Finder

This is a single-page web application that allows users to search for real-time events using the Ticketmaster API. It provides a user-friendly interface to discover events, view them on a map, and save them for later.

## Features

*   **Live Event Search:** Instantly search for events by location, category, or keyword. Results update automatically as you type (debounced search).
*   **Advanced Filtering:** Filter events by date range (Today, This Weekend, Next 7 Days) and price range (min/max).
*   **Interactive Map View:** Events are displayed on an interactive map using Leaflet.js, with marker clustering for better performance with a large number of events. The map automatically zooms to fit the search results. Map popups include a direct link to Google Maps for directions.

*   **In-Page Event Details:** View comprehensive details for each event in a modal overlay, including additional information like price ranges and notes.
